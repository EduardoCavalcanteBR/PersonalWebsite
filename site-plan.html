        Kazzei Films specializes in storytelling through videos and recording key moments in people's lives.
        Photo and video go far beyond just recording an occasion. The phrase of the Brazilian poet, translator 
        and journalist Mário Quintana “The photographer has the same mission as the poet: to immortalize the 
        passing moment.” And we already know that photos and videos are the most important ways to immortalize 
        feelings, experiences and achievements, they allow us to look into the past to relive all that again, 
        and that is the purpose of this Portfolio page, to show the records already done.
