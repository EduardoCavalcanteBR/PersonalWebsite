                        Photo and video go far beyond just recording an occasion. The phrase of the Brazilian poet, translator and journalist Mário Quintana 
                        “The photographer has the same mission as the poet: to immortalize the passing moment.” And we already know that photos and videos are 
                        the most important ways to immortalize feelings, experiences and achievements. It is through photos and videos that we can remember moments 
                        and keep forever moments that words cannot describe, after all, every record brings with it the key to unique and special memories.

                        to keep in mind what we have lived through, who we know, what we were, how we grew up. Photos and videos allow us to look into the past 
                        to relive it all over again.
